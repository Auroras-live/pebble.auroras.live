# pebble.auroras.live

This repo contains the source code for the Auroras.live Pebble Watch App.

## Installation

Import the project to CloudPebble.net and build it from there. It may also be possible to build it from the command line, but this hasn't been tested.

## Notes

 - This code does not include the functions to register the Pebble for the timeline, as the timeline will eventually be switched off due to Fitbit's acquisition of Pebble.
 - This code has been tested on the Pebble and Pebble Time, but not the Pebble 2 or Pebble Round. Adjustments will need to be made in order to get the code to run on those platforms.
